![Water Pollution Map](./Global%20Water%20Pollutiuon.png)

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes **global water pollution** across different countries. The interactive visualization was created in Tableau and showcases pollution data on a world map, helping to identify regions significantly affected by water contamination.

---

## Key Insights  
1. **Geographic Trends**:  
   - Different regions display varying degrees of water pollution.  
   - Countries in **Asia** and parts of **Africa** have dense clusters of pollution points.  
   - Developed nations show relatively fewer pollution points.  

2. **Visual Features**:  
   - The map uses **colored dots**, where **each color represents a country**.  
   - Hovering over the dots reveals specific details about pollution in that region.

## Features  
- **World Map Visualization**: Interactive and easy to understand.  
- **Country-Specific Data**: Color-coded points for quick identification of affected regions.  
- **Global Coverage**: Data spans multiple continents.

## Tools Used  
- **Tableau**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.  
- **Mapbox**: For geographical mapping.  
- **Data Sources**: Water pollution data from kaggle.
